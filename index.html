    <p>One of the reasons I like coding is because I play videogames, and I want to know how they work. I also want to hopefully make coding into a job so I can do something that I really like for a job. Hopefully I can work at some big company so I make a lot of money doing something I like.</p>

    <h1>Why YOU Should Start Learning How To Code</h1>
              <div class = "line"></div>
              <p>Have you ever been on a website or platform and though,'I wish that instead of this is would be this'. Then start learning how to code. With learning how to code you can make any website or video platform or messaging platform from SCRATCH! If you also dont want a boring 9 to 5 job in the future, you can do coding for a job!The limit is your Imagination. </p>
